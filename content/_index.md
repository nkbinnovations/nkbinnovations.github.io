I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in DevOps, cloud engineering, and integration solutions. My career includes successful projects and roles at prestigious organizations such as Sainsbury's Supermarkets and TATA Consultancy Services. I have a proven track record of developing and implementing strategies that enhance the speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of application deployments and cloud migrations.

In my current role as a Senior Engineer at Sainsbury's Supermarkets, I have led the transformation of legacy application infrastructure and implemented automation processes that significantly reduced manual tasks. My expertise in migrating Jenkins code to GitHub Actions has resulted in substantial cost savings for the organization.

Previously, as a Senior DevOps Engineer at TATA Consultancy Services, I delivered integration solutions on Microsoft Azure, managed containerized platforms, and created Azure infrastructure components using Terraform and Jenkins. My hands-on experience with Docker containerization and Kubernetes has been instrumental in driving successful cloud migration projects.

I hold a diverse skill set that includes AWS, Microsoft Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and more. My certifications in Snowflake further attest to my commitment to continuous learning and professional development.

I am confident that my technical acumen, coupled with my strong communication skills and ability to work collaboratively with stakeholders, make me a valuable asset to any organization. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team and drive impactful results.
